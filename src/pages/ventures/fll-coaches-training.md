Two of our volunteers, Rohan Suri and Aditya Jain, were nominated by the Missouri FIRST organization to train Coaches on multiple occasions with the new LEGO SPIKE Prime system. During the first training, Rohan and Aditya trained Girl Scout FLL coaches, and during the second, they were livestreamed/recorded at the official Missouri FIRST Coaches Training event.
