title: Robotics Summer Camps
description: During the summer of 2021, two of our volunteers (Rohan Suri and Aditya Jain) created an LCSRC sponsored Robotics Camp for kids from 5th -7th grade who wanted to advance their knowledge in STEM fields and/or participate in the FIRST Robotics Program. After the conclusion of the program, Rohan and Aditya went on to coach an FLL team (see FIRST Team page) that went on to win the Innovation Project Award at the 2021 MICDS FLL Qualifier.
